**PRISMATIC** is a Python-based tool designed to analyze and determine redshifts and redshift quality flags from **JWST NIRSpec prism spectra**. This program is optimized for handling low-resolution spectra obtained from the NIRSpec prism, in particular spectra from the **The CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS)** JWST program (GO 6368, PI Dickinson).
