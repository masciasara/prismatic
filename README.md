**PRISMATIC** is a Python-based tool designed to analyze and determine redshifts and redshift quality flags from **JWST NIRSpec prism spectra**. This program is optimized for handling low-resolution spectra obtained from the NIRSpec prism, in particular spectra from the **The CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS)** JWST program (GO 6368, PI Dickinson).

## Features  
- **Redshift Estimation**: Automatically includes best redshifts solution from several independent codes, obtainesd using spectral line identification and/or template fitting.  
- **JWST Optimization**: Tailored for NIRSpec prism spectra, ensuring compatibility with JWST data products.  
- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive user interface and simple configuration options for fast setup and analysis.
